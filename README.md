---PROGRAM---


   - The purpose of this program is to compare the weight of cooked chicken
using different methods(?) and computing the average weight lost after cooking
the chicken. The program asks for the chicken inputs, writes the inputs
to a separate file, and reads this file to compute the average weight lost.
Using this weight lost value, the program returns the accompanying 
chicken macro values.
